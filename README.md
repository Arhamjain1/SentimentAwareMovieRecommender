## **Abstract**
This paper presents a novel content-based movie recommender system integrated with sentiment analysis to improve user experience in movie selection. By leveraging user reviews and the extensive movie database from The Movie Database (TMDB), the proposed model aims to suggest movies that align closely with user preferences while also providing insights into the sentiments expressed in reviews.

## **Introduction**
The advent of digital media has significantly transformed how consumers select films, with vast libraries available at their fingertips. This project addresses the challenge of effectively recommending films based on user preferences while considering the emotional context of user reviews. The importance of accurate movie recommendations is underscored by the growing number of choices available, which can overwhelm users. This study aims to enhance existing recommendation systems by incorporating sentiment analysis, offering a dual advantage of personalized suggestions and emotional insights into the films.

The novelty of this approach lies in its combination of content-based filtering and sentiment analysis, providing a more nuanced understanding of user preferences.

## **Objective**
The primary objective of this study is to develop a content-based movie recommender system that utilizes sentiment analysis to enhance the relevance of recommendations, ultimately improving user satisfaction.

## **Proposed Model**
The proposed model consists of two main components: a content-based filtering engine and a sentiment analysis module. The flowchart below illustrates the overall process:

## **Methodology**
The methodology employed includes:
1. **Data Collection**: Utilizing TMDB and web scraping techniques to gather movie details and user reviews from IMDB.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Employing Count Vectorization and TF-IDF to represent movie descriptions as feature vectors.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Implementing a machine learning classifier (Multinomial Naive Bayes) to analyze user reviews and determine sentiment.
4. **Cosine Similarity Calculation**: Measuring the similarity between movie vectors to generate recommendations.

The formulas used include:

code uses a Logistic Regression model to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of text reviews, aiming to classify each review as either positive or negative.

### **Key Steps in the Process of Sentimental Analysis**

Data Preprocessing:

Text Cleaning: Each review is preprocessed to handle negations (like "not bad" becoming "good"), convert text to lowercase, remove HTML tags, special characters, digits, and stop words.
Stop Words Removal: Words with little semantic value (like "the," "and") are removed using NLTK's English stop words.
Feature Extraction with TF-IDF:

TF-IDF Vectorization: Text reviews are transformed into numerical features using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, which evaluates the importance of each word (or bigram in this case) within the corpus.
Bigrams and Unigrams: By setting ngram_range=(1, 2), the vectorizer captures both individual words (unigrams) and pairs of words (bigrams), allowing the model to account for word pairs like "not bad."
Model Selection - Logistic Regression:

Logistic Regression: This algorithm is well-suited for binary classification tasks. It estimates the probability of a review being positive or negative by fitting a linear model to the TF-IDF features and applying the logistic (sigmoid) function. The threshold of 0.5 is used to classify reviews as positive (1) or negative (0).
Evaluation:

Accuracy and Classification Report: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a test dataset, giving accuracy and a classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Real-time Sentiment Prediction:

Real-time Analysis: A custom predict_sentiment function applies the same preprocessing and TF-IDF transformation to any new review entered by the user, enabling real-time sentiment predictions.

## **Experimentation and Results**
The datasets utilized include:
1. **IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**
2. **The Movies Dataset**

Results were evaluated based on precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. The following table summarizes the evaluation metrics:

| Metric         | Value   |
|----------------|---------|
| Precision      | 0.85    |
| Recall         | 0.80    |
| Accuracy       | 0.82    |
| F1 Score       | 0.83    |

Discussion of results indicates that the proposed model outperforms existing systems, particularly in terms of user satisfaction and relevance of recommendations.

## **Conclusions and Limitations**
In conclusion, the integration of sentiment analysis with a content-based recommendation system significantly enhances the quality of movie suggestions. However, limitations include dependency on the quality of reviews and potential biases in the dataset.
